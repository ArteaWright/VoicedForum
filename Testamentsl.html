                        <p class="testament-p">On May 25, 2020, George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, was killed in
                            Minneapolis, Minnesota, while being arrested for allegedly using a counterfeit bill. During
                            the arrest Derek Chauvin, a police officer with the Minneapolis Police Department, knelt on
                            Floyd's neck for several minutes after he was handcuffed and lying face down. Two police
                            officers, J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane, helped Chauvin in restraining Floyd.</p>

                            fire on a crowd that had gathered at a parking lot on 26th and Broadway. As the owner of
                            YaYa’s BBQ, McAtee was known to give police officers free meals. Bystanders and witnesses
                            have said that the crowd was not protesting when the police arrived.</p>

                            African-American man, was pursued and fatally shot while jogging near Brunswick in Glynn
                            County, Georgia. Arbery had been pursued by three white residents—Travis McMichael and his
                            father Gregory, who were armed and driving a pickup truck, and William "Roddie" Bryan, who
                            followed Arbery in a second vehicle—and was confronted and fatally shot by Travis McMichael.
